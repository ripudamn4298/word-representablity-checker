# word-representablity-checker
We’ve developed a tool to check if graphs with 8 or fewer vertices are word-representable—a challenging NP-complete problem. While it currently handles only small graphs, this is a significant step forward. Future optimizations may extend its capabilities to larger graphs, enhancing our ability to tackle complex instances.
