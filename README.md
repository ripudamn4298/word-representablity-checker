# Word-Representability-Checker
We’ve developed a tool to check if graphs with 8 or fewer vertices are word-representable—a challenging NP-complete problem. While it currently handles only small graphs, this is a significant step forward. Future optimizations may extend its capabilities to larger graphs, enhancing our ability to tackle complex instances.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Compile the C++ code by running `g++ Word_representability_check.cpp -o Word_representability_check`.
4. Run the compiled executable by executing `./Word_representability_check`.

Input the order you want to check; the code will make an output_order.txt file for the results.

The input file contains all the nonisomorphic graphs separated by their order.
